### Problem Statement:
Using machine learning, we should be able to predict the images on the new set of data using the model that we have trained on the existing data by reducing the 8x8 pixels provided in the dataset using PCA.

### PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis and machine learning. It is used to extract the underlying structure in a large set of possibly correlated variables, and to represent this structure in a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

PCA works by transforming the data into a new coordinate system, where the first principal component has the highest variance, the second principal component has the second-highest variance, and so on. By retaining only the first few principal components, PCA effectively compresses the information in the original data into a lower-dimensional representation.

PCA is commonly used for data visualization, to identify patterns and correlations in the data, to reduce the dimensionality of the data for use in machine learning algorithms, and for feature extraction. It is a useful tool for exploring and understanding high-dimensional datasets, and can be applied to a variety of data types, including images, text, and numerical data.
